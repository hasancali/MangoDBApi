MongoDB is one of the most popular Document based NOSQL Database with all the flexibility and scalability that your application would ever need. MongoDB is extensively used by large tech giants for storing high volumes of data. Instead of using the traditional SQL Tables and Rows, MongoDB stores data in JSON objects which is much more efficient than the traditional row/column approach.

MongoDB is highly cross platform and can just work with about everything.

Let’s setting up MongoDB Server and ultimately building a .NET Core 6.0 WebAPI that does CRUD operations on a MongoDB Instances.
